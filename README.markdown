Python library for accessing Greenview web service
=============

Installation
-------

Its pretty simple at the moment, just copy the greenview.py module into a directory somewhere and import it to use the base library.
The update.py module can be run as a script to set up json files for five buildings.
Both update.py and test.py show how to use the greenview.py module to pull data from the webservice.
